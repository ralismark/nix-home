Tags like "stupid," "bad at __", "sloppy," and so on, are ways of saying
"You're performing badly and I don't know why." Once you move it to "you're
performing badly because you have the wrong fingerings," or "you're performing
badly because you don't understand what a limit is," it's no longer a vague
personal failing but a causal necessity.

Anyone who never understood limits will flunk calculus. It's not you, it's the
bug.
